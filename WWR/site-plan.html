    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h2>My focus is to create complex actions from both frontend and backend.</h2>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this site is to show my portifolio and a little bit about myself, my projects, 
      my ambitions and my experiencies as developer.
      Through the portfolio I can prove that I am a good programmer. 
      And for those who have not yet developed professionally or who are curious to learn and start to 
      become a developer, these projects can be useful to anyone interested, whether frontend or backend. 
      Here I can demonstrate my skills, show projects and finish products or in development, instead of just 
      talking about them. Even though I am a beginner student, I already want to join as soon as possible to 
      learn more and share my new learnings. Some of the topics and differentials found in my portfolio are 
      front and back-end skills and techniques, use of optimization strategies such as SEO, techniques to 
      improve the loading of a website, use of scripts.</p>

    <h4>[This Portifolio]</h4>
    <p>Through the portfolio I can prove that I am a good programmer. And for those who have not yet 
      developed professionally or who are curious to learn and start to become a developer, these 
      projects can be useful to anyone interested, whether frontend or backend. Here I can demonstrate 
      my skills, show projects and finish products or in development, instead of just talking about them.
      Even though I am a beginner student, I already want to join as soon as possible to learn more and 
      share my new learnings.
      Some of the topics and differentials found in my portfolio are front and back-end skills 
      and techniques, use of optimization strategies such as SEO, techniques to improve the 
      loading of a website, use of scripts.
      Talking a little bit about myself, in my personality and profile I am constantly developing my 
      front end and backend skills. with a dream to be a software engineer. creative and proactive, 
      ready for new challenges. As children we are asked what we want to be when we grow up, most of 
      the answers are “traditional” professions like doctors, police officers, firefighters, dancers 
      and astronauts. However, the professional market is much broader and as I grew up I found new 
      job possibilities, I changed my tastes, habits and preference for work. I was a teenager fascinated
      by computers and I discovered that I wanted to work in front of one, where I was an administrative 
      assistant for a while, until I discovered the area of Information Technology. I started to build 
      simple or complex systems through programming languages by myself watching videos and researching 
      materials on the internet. In addition, I started to carry out the tests to verify that everything 
      is working correctly. 
      In the midst of my studies I acquired some knowledge that can help beginners in programming. 
      Studying and learning: HTML5, CSS3, Python, GIT and Github. I will give a brief description 
      to curious and interested newbies, and also a general aggregate of my knowledge to potential 
      contractors.It ranks one of the most used programming languages among programmers according to the Stack 
      Overflow Survey, and one of the cleanest and common the easier for the beginners too. 
      Python has features that allow the programming professional to describe a new functionality in 
      the code with fewer lines, compared to other programming languages. Because it is so popular, 
      this technological language has a vast community of professionals all over the world. This allows 
      you to have quick support and helps you understand what a programmer who codes with this language 
      does.Although HTML is not necessarily a programming language but a markup language, 
      it is one of the front end developer's best friends and the gateway to many beginners in 
      the programming world. This is due to its popularity and the increase in the number of 
      professionals who understand this markup to build websites and web interfaces. In general, 
      HTML markup serves to tell the browser what it should present and in what order it should be 
      presented. CSS is a style sheet that can be applied to HTML. This sheet tells the browser that 
      that function should be performed in a more pleasant way. In a construction for example, 
      the HTML would be the raw part of the construction, like foundation, walls and beams and the CSS 
      would be the finish like the plaster, paint and floor.
      GitHub is the world's largest shared data repository. 
      This is a platform mostly used by developers as it allows convenient hosting of source 
      code and files in the cloud.
      Git is a file version control repository used for source code versioning and 
      collaborative development.</p>
