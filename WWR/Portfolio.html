    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>Talking a little bit about myself, in my personality and profile I am constantly developing my 
        front end and backend skills. with a dream to be a software engineer. creative and proactive, 
        ready for new challenges. As children we are asked what we want to be when we grow up, most of 
        the answers are “traditional” professions like doctors, police officers, firefighters, dancers 
        and astronauts. However, the professional market is much broader and as I grew up I found new 
        job possibilities, I changed my tastes, habits and preference for work. I was a teenager fascinated
        by computers and I discovered that I wanted to work in front of one, where I was an administrative 
        assistant for a while, until I discovered the area of Information Technology. I started to build 
        simple and complex systems through programming languages by myself watching videos and researching 
        materials on the internet. In addition, I started to carry out the tests to verify that everything 
        is working correctly.</p>
      <p>And this is a bit about me...</p>

        <p class="overview">My focus is to create complex actions from both frontend and backend. 
          Through the portfolio I can prove that I am a good programmer. And for those who have not yet 
          developed professionally or who are curious to learn and start to become a developer, these 
          projects can be useful to anyone interested, whether frontend or backend. Here I can demonstrate 
          my skills, show projects and finish products or in development, instead of just talking about them.
          Even though I am a beginner student, I already want to join as soon as possible to learn more and 
          share my new learnings. </p>
        <h2 class="purpose">The purpose of this site is to show my portifolio and a little bit about myself, 
            my projects, my ambitions and my experiencies as developer.
