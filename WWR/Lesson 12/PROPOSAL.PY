#- TIME: I SPENDED BY MORE THEN 9 HOURS STUDING AND DOING RESEARCHES FOR THE PROGRAM AT THIS TIME
#- ORGANIZATION: IS A EASY CODE TO READ, THERE IS A HOW TO PLAY INSTRUCTIONS, A BOARD SIMPLY DRAWNED BY THE PRINT, A FUNCTION TO CHOOSE A NUMBER OF THE BOARD(IF THE NUMBER IS CHOOSEN OR DOESNT EXISTS IN THE BOARD, A MESSAGE OF ERROR WILL APEAR),  THE TURN OF EACH PLAYER WILL APPEAR TO GET THE CHOOSEN NUMBER AND THE WINNER IS THE ONE WHO TAKES X, Y OR Z VERTICES.
#- PROGRESS: I'M VERY PROUD OF MYSELF GETING THE X, Y, Z VERTICES, THE MAGIC BOX AND MAKE IT RIDE CLEAN FOR TWO PLAYER, NOW  I'MTRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT HOW TO PLAY AGAINST THE CPU
#- DESCRIPTION: IT IS A HASH GAME FOR TWO PLAYERS, THE FIRST PLAYER IS THE X AND THE SECOND THE O IN A BORD BETWEEN 1 TO 9 OF NUMBER TO CHOOSE CORRESPONDING THE SET TO THE BOARD
