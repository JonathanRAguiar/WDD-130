            Through the portfolio I can prove that I am a good programmer. And for those who have not yet 
            developed professionally or who are curious to learn and start to become a developer, these 
            projects can be useful to anyone interested, whether frontend or backend. Here I can demonstrate 
            my skills, show projects and finish products or in development, instead of just talking about them.
            Even though I am a beginner student, I already want to join as soon as possible to learn more and 
            share my new learnings.
            Some of the topics and differentials found in my portfolio are front and back-end skills 
            and techniques, use of optimization strategies such as SEO, techniques to improve the 
            loading of a website, use of scripts.

        <h1>A bit about me</h1>
        
        <h3>
            Talking a little bit about myself, in my personality and profile I am constantly developing my 
            front end and backend skills. with a dream to be a software engineer. creative and proactive, 
            ready for new challenges. As children we are asked what we want to be when we grow up, most of 
            the answers are “traditional” professions like doctors, police officers, firefighters, dancers 
            and astronauts. However, the professional market is much broader and as I grew up I found new 
            job possibilities, I changed my tastes, habits and preference for work. I was a teenager fascinated
            by computers and I discovered that I wanted to work in front of one, where I was an administrative 
            assistant for a while, until I discovered the area of Information Technology. I started to build 
            simple or complex systems through programming languages by myself watching videos and researching 
            materials on the internet. In addition, I started to carry out the tests to verify that everything 
            is working correctly.

        <h1>My knowledge</h1>
        
        <h3>
            In the midst of my studies I acquired some knowledge that can help beginners in programming. 
            Studying and learning: HTML5, CSS3, Python, GIT and Github. I will give a brief description 
            to curious and interested newbies, and also a general aggregate of my knowledge to potential 
            contractors.

        <h2>Python</h2>
        <h3>
            It ranks one of the most used programming languages among programmers according to the Stack 
            Overflow Survey, and one of the cleanest and common the easier for the beginners too. 
            Python has features that allow the programming professional to describe a new functionality in 
            the code with fewer lines, compared to other programming languages. Because it is so popular, 
            this technological language has a vast community of professionals all over the world. This allows 
            you to have quick support and helps you understand what a programmer who codes with this language 
            does.

        <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>

        <h3>
            Although HTML is not necessarily a programming language but a markup language, 
            it is one of the front end developer's best friends and the gateway to many beginners in 
            the programming world. This is due to its popularity and the increase in the number of 
            professionals who understand this markup to build websites and web interfaces. In general, 
            HTML markup serves to tell the browser what it should present and in what order it should be 
            presented. CSS is a style sheet that can be applied to HTML. This sheet tells the browser that 
            that function should be performed in a more pleasant way. In a construction for example, 
            the HTML would be the raw part of the construction, like foundation, walls and beams and the CSS 
            would be the finish like the plaster, paint and floor.
