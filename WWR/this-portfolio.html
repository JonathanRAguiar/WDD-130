        <h1>My knowledge</h1>
        
        <h3>
            In the midst of my studies I acquired some knowledge that can help beginners in programming. 
            Studying and learning: HTML5, CSS3, Python, GIT and Github. I will give a brief description 
            to curious and interested newbies, and also a general aggregate of my knowledge to potential 
            contractors.

        <h2>Python</h2>
        <h3>
            It ranks one of the most used programming languages among programmers according to the Stack 
            Overflow Survey, and one of the cleanest and common the easier for the beginners too. 
            Python has features that allow the programming professional to describe a new functionality in 
            the code with fewer lines, compared to other programming languages. Because it is so popular, 
            this technological language has a vast community of professionals all over the world. This allows 
            you to have quick support and helps you understand what a programmer who codes with this language 
            does.

        <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>

        <h3>
          
            This is due to its popularity and the increase in the number of 
            professionals who understand this markup to build websites and web interfaces. In general, 
            HTML markup serves to tell the browser what it should present and in what order it should be 
            presented. CSS is a style sheet that can be applied to HTML. This sheet tells the browser that 
            that function should be performed in a more pleasant way. In a construction for example, 
            the HTML would be the raw part of the construction, like foundation, walls and beams and the CSS 
            would be the finish like the plaster, paint and floor.
        </h3>
        <h2>Github</h2>
        <img class="logo" src="images/Git-hub-icon.png" alt="github_logo">
        <h3>
            GitHub is the world's largest shared data repository. 
            This is a platform mostly used by developers as it allows convenient hosting of source 
            code and files in the cloud
        </h3>
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <img class="logo" src="images/Git-Icon-1788C.png" alt="git_logo">
        <h3>
            Git is a file version control repository used for source code versioning and 
            collaborative development.
